<h3 class="page-title about-me">I'm Dashiell Lumas, a full-stack web developer based in Washington Heights, NYC.  I develop functional, clean and well-organized websites that speak to my passions. I love to learn languages, both programming and human. Everyday is a learning process, and this website speaks to that journey. Look to the blog section for content about my favorite technologies, languages and even code snippets! </h3>
